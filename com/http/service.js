/**
 * Federated authentication service.
 *
 * This component provides an HTTP service that initiates authentication with a
 * federated identity provider (IdP).
 *
 * Authentication occurs via a protocol such as [OpenID Connect][1], in which
 * the user's web browser is redirected to the IdP.  The IdP then redirects
 * the user back to the application, with an assertion regarding the
 * authentication that was performed.  This package includes support for OpenID
 * Connect, [OAuth 2.0][2], and [OAuth 1.0][3].  Support for other protocols,
 * such as [SAML][4], can be obtained by installing other packages.
 *
 * "Authentication" is a bit of a misnomer in this context, as authentication is
 * performed by the IdP, rather than the application.  In other words,
 * authentication is delegated to the IdP.  The application authenticates an
 * assertion issued by the IdP, and relies on the claims within to establish the
 * authentication context.
 *
 * It should be noted that this service is responsible only for initiating
 * authentication, by redirecting to the IdP.  The redirect from the IdP back to
 * the application will be handled by a protocol-specific service.
 *
 * By default, this service will be mounted under the path `/login/federated`.
 * This name was chosen for consistency with the terminology of [Credential
 * Management][5], in particular the [`FederatedCredential`][6] interface.
 * Note, however, that the association extends no further - any use of
 * Credential Management APIs in client-side JavaScript is not implied and
 * left to the application.
